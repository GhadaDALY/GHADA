156
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:16,819
- Well, I can't see that lasting long.
- Thank you, Miss O'Brien.

157
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:50,978
BATES: Oh, yes.

158
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,985
(SIGHS) I should be comfortable here.

159
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:04,241
Does this mean I'll have to
go into full mourning?

160
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:11,957
My first cousin and his son
are almost certainly dead.

161
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:17,963
- We'll all be in mourning.
- No, I mean with the other thing.

162
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:21,467
After all, it wasn't official.

163
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:25,971
Lfyou're saying you do not wish to
mourn Patrick as a fiance, that is up to you.

164
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,307
Well, no one knew about it
outside the family.

165
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:30,309
I repeat, it is up to you.

166
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:32,311
Well, that's a relief.

167
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,077
There's some cedar-lined cupboards
in the attic

168
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:52,289
for things that aren't often worn,
travelling clothes and such.

169
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:55,292
Mr Watson used them to
rotate the summer and winter stuff.

170
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:57,252
I'll show you later.

171
00:13:57,754 --> 00:14:01,340
What about studs and links?
Do I choose them or does he?

172
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:04,218
Lay them out unless he asks
for something in particular.

173
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:08,430
These for a ball, these for an ordinary dinner,
these only in London.

174
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:11,850
- I'll get the hang of it.
- Yeah, you'll have to.

175
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:18,774
Snuff boxes, he collects them.

176
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:21,318
BATES: Beautiful.

177
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,864
- Funny ourjob, isn't it?
- What do you mean?

178
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:31,662
The way we live with all this pirate's hoard
within our reach.

179
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:34,289
But none of it's ours, is it?

180
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:37,709
No, none of it's ours.

181
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:51,598
I can't believe I've been passed over
for Long John Silver.

182
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:53,850
You should have spoken up
when you had the chance.

183
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:55,644
Don't make the same mistake next time.

184
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:58,480
Who says there'll be a next time?

185
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:01,817
Is this a public holiday no one's told me of?

186
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:10,033
She was certainly reluctant
to go into mourning.

187
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,619
Well, she'll have to. We all will.

188
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:14,538
O'Brien's sorting out my black now.

189
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:18,667
And I've told Anna to see what the girls have
that still fits.

190
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:22,421
Ofcourse, this alters everything.

191
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:26,550
You won't try to deny it.

192
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:29,678
You must challenge the entail now, surely.

193
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:33,265
Can't we at least wait until
we know they're dead before we discuss it?

194
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:36,852
Don't talk as if I'm not brokenhearted,
because I am.

195
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:41,398
Ofcourse, I've never understood why
this estate must go

196
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:43,108
to whomever inherits your title.

197
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:46,570
My dear, I don't make the law. What is it?

198
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:49,364
CARSON: The Dowager Countess is
in the drawing room.

199
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:52,576
- I'll come now.
- She asked for Lady Grantham.

200
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:55,329
I wonder what I've done wrong this time.

201
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:58,415
Oh. And the new valet has arrived, my lord.

202
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,709
Has he? Thank you, Carson.

203
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,461
(CLEARS THROAT)

204
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:03,920
What is it?

205
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:07,841
I'm not entirely sure
that he'll prove equal to the task.

206
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:11,219
But your lordship will be the judge ofthat.

207
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:16,933
Better go.

208
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:22,773
Tell her about James and Patrick.
She won't have heard.

209
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,234
Ofcourse I've heard.
Why else would I be here?

210
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:29,905
Robert didn't want you to read about it
in the newspaper and be upset.

211
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,740
He flatters me.

212
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:33,992
I'm tougher than I look.

213
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:37,663
I'm very sorry about poor Patrick, ofcourse.

214
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:40,832
- He was a nice boy.
- We were all so fond of him.

215
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:43,251
But I never cared for James.

216
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:48,090
He was too like his mother
and a nastier woman never drew breath.

217
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,803
- Will you stay for some luncheon?
- Thank you.

218
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:54,888
- I'll let Carson know.
- I've already told him.

219
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,765
Shall we sit down?

220
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:05,649
- Do you know the new heir?
- Only that there is one.

221
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:09,361
He's Robert's third cousin, once removed.

222
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,947
I have never to my knowledge
set eyes on him.

223
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:16,702
Ofcourse, ifyour late husband hadn't forced
me to sign that absurd act of legal theft...

224
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:19,621
My dear, I didn't come here to fight.

225
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:22,791
Lord Grantham wanted to protect the estate.

226
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,627
It never occurred to him
that you wouldn't have a son.

227
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:29,548
- Well, I didn't.
- No, you did not.

228
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:32,676
But when Patrick had married Mary

229
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:37,472
and your grandson been hailed as master,
honour would have been satisfied.

230
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:40,475
(SIGHS) Unfortunately, now...

231
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,228
Now, a complete unknown has the right
to pocket my money

232
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,897
along with the rest ofthe swag.

233
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:50,944
The problem is, saving your dowry
would break up the estate.

234
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:54,865
It would be the ruin ofeverything
Robert's given his life to.

235
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:59,202
- And he knows this?
- Well, if he doesn't, he will.

236
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:04,124
- Then there's no answer.
- Yes, there is, and it's a simple one.

237
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:10,130
The entail must be smashed in its entirety

238
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,717
and Mary recognised as heiress of all.

239
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:18,138
- There's nothing we can do about the title.
- No.

240
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:22,225
She can't have the title,
but she can have your money.

241
00:18:23,186 --> 00:18:24,770
And the estate.

242
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:28,648
I didn't run Downton for 30 years

243
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:34,613
to see it go lock, stock and barrel
to a stranger from God knows where.

244
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,281
(SIGHS)

245
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,909
Are we to be friends, then?

246
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:48,335
We are allies, my dear,
which can be a good deal more effective.

247
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:56,843
Downton is a great house, Mr Bates.
And the Crawleys are a great family.

248
00:18:57,178 --> 00:19:01,973
We live by certain standards and
those standards can at first seem daunting.

249
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:03,225
Ofcourse.

250
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:06,728
Lfyou find yourselftongue-tied
in the presence of his lordship,

251
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:10,232
I can only assure you
that his manners and grace

252
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:13,860
will soon help you to perform your duties
to the best ofyour ability.

253
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:14,986
I know.

254
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,864
Bates, my dear fellow.

255
00:19:17,949 --> 00:19:20,742
I do apologise, I should have realised
you'd all be at luncheon.

256
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:23,370
- Not at all, my lord.
- Please, sit. Sit, everyone.

257
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:26,998
I just want to say a quick hello
to my old comrade in arms.

258
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,960
Bates, my dear man, welcome to Downton.

259
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,045
Thank you, sir.

260
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:37,551
I'm so sorry to have disturbed you all.
Please forgive me.

261
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:47,769
You never asked.

262
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,943
Thomas, take that up.

263
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:57,904
Leave it, Daisy! He's a grown man.

264
00:19:57,989 --> 00:20:00,115
I suppose he can lift a meat pie.

265
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:03,326
Now, put that apple tart in the lower oven.

266
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:08,373
Oh, and take that away.
Mr Lynch shouldn't have left it there.

267
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,250
- What is it?
- Salt of Sorrel.

268
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:13,295
I asked him for some to clean the brass pots.

269
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:16,506
So, put it somewhere careful. It's poison.

270
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:21,136
Seems like a lot offood
when you think they're all in mourning.

271
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:25,932
Nothing makes you hungrier or more tired
than grief.

272
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:28,685
When my sister died, God rest her soul,

273
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:31,980
I ate my way through four platefuls
ofsandwiches at one sitting

274
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,107
and slept round the clock.

275
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:36,484
Did it make you feel better?

276
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,945
Not much, but it passed the time.

277
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:42,741
Oh, my Lord! What was this chopped egg
supposed to be sprinkled on?

278
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:46,369
- Was it the chicken?
- It was. Take it upstairs now.

279
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:49,289
- I can't go in the dining room.
- I should think not.

280
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,875
Find Thomas or William
and tell them what to do.

281
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:55,462
And for heaven's sake get a move on, girl,
before they get back from church.

282
00:20:56,964 --> 00:21:01,635
Well, we've given them a memorial in London
and a memorial here.

283
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:05,847
MURRAY: I prefer memorials to funerals,
they're less dispiriting.

284
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:09,017
We could hardly have held a funeral
without the bodies.

285
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:13,313
I gather they're putting up a stone to
mark those whose bodies were never found.

286
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:17,442
In fact, I hear the Canadians are making
quite a thing at the Titanic cemetery.

287
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,486
I'm surprised at the number they found.

288
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:22,948
You'd think the sea
would've taken more ofthem.

289
00:21:25,076 --> 00:21:28,620
So, Murray, what have you to tell me
about the lucky Mr Crawley?

290
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,372
Nothing too terrible, I hope.

291
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:35,168
(CHUCKLES) I've only made a few inquiries
but, no, there's not much to alarm you.

292
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:38,254
Matthew Crawley is a solicitor
based in Manchester.

293
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:39,798
Manchester?

294
00:21:40,383 --> 00:21:42,926
His special field is company law.

295
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:46,388
His mother is alive and he lives with her.

296
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:49,391
His father obviously is not. He was a doctor.

297
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:50,767
I know.

298
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:54,521
It does seem odd that
my third cousin should be a doctor.

299
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:57,023
There are worse professions.

300
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,192
Indeed.

301
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:09,828
Do me a favour. This is supposed to be
sprinkled on the chicken.

302
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:12,789
- But isn't there more to go up?
- Oh, please, it won't take a moment.

303
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:14,374
- Go on then, give it here.
- Okay.

304
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:18,670
MURRAY: We ought to talk about
the business ofthe entail.

305
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:23,216
As you know, on your death,
the heir to the title inherits everything,

306
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:27,012
except for the sums set aside
for your daughters and your widow.

307
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:28,221
Yes.

308
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:30,390
Owing to the terms of her settlement,

309
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:33,893
this will include the bulk
ofyour wife's fortune.

310
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:36,604
(SIGHS) It has been our sole topic
ofconversation

311
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:37,814
since the day the ship went down.

312
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:41,693
MURRAY: Ofcourse it must seem
horribly unjust to Lady Grantham,

313
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,445
but that is how the law stands.

314
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:46,239
Is there really no way to detach her money
from the estate?

315
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:48,575
Even to me, it seems absurd.

316
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:53,163
Your father tied the knots pretty tight.
I'd say it's unbreakable.

317
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:54,456
I see.

318
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:59,127
Really, Edith, do you have to put on
such an exhibition?

319
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,628
She's not.

320
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,882
I was supposed to be engaged to him,
for heaven's sake, not you.

321
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:06,217
And I can control myself.

322
00:23:06,469 --> 00:23:08,678
Then you should be ashamed.

323
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:13,183
Oh, and don't tell me
you've not sent up the egg yet.

324
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:18,730
Oh, God, help me! Please, God, help me!

325
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:20,231
Well, what on earth's the matter?

326
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:22,859
Just run upstairs to the dining room
and find William. I beg you.

327
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:24,778
- I can't do that now.
- You've got to.

328
00:23:24,862 --> 00:23:26,696
- I'll be hanged ifyou don't.
- What?

329
00:23:26,781 --> 00:23:28,364
Daisy, is that you?

330
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:31,534
Is it the chicken in a sauce
or the plain chicken with sliced oranges?

331
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:36,581
Oh, thank you, blessed and merciful Lord!
Thank you.

332
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:38,792
It's the chicken in the sauce.

333
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:43,171
I'll never do anything sinful again, I swear it.
Not till I die.

334
00:23:46,509 --> 00:23:49,803
Mr Murray, how lovely to see you.
Do come in.

335
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:52,847
You're very kind, Lady Grantham,
but I must get back to London.

336
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:57,352
- But you'll stay for luncheon?
- Thank you, but no, I'll eat on the train.

337
00:23:57,436 --> 00:24:01,815
In fact, ifyou'd be so good as to ask
for the motor be brought round?

338
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:05,068
But didn't you want the afternoon
to talk things through?

339
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:08,321
I think we've said everything we have to say,
haven't we, my lord?

340
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:10,156
For the time being, yes.

341
00:24:10,241 --> 00:24:13,701
Thank you, Murray.
You've given me a good deal to think about.

342
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:20,416
Mary, try to get everyone
into the dining room.

343
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:23,795
Edith, make sure old Lord Minterne
sits down.

344
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,717
- (KNOCKING ON DOOR)
- Mmm-hmm.

345
00:24:30,553 --> 00:24:33,638
- They've all gone?
- They have, thank the Lord.

346
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:37,642
- Oh, what about the lawyer?
- Oh, he was the first away.

347
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,727
Didn't even stay for the luncheon.

348
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:42,313
I wish they'd make their minds up.

349
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:44,607
Gwen's put clean sheets
on the Blue Room bed.

350
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:46,943
Now she'll just have to strip it again.

351
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:51,156
- Can't you leave it for the next guest?
- Well, only ifyou don't tell.

352
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,740
(CHUCKLES)

353
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:57,662
So, has it all been settled?

354
00:24:57,997 --> 00:25:00,707
No. I don't know if anything's been settled.

355
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:03,960
There's a fellow in Manchester
with claims to the title, I gather,

356
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:07,881
but it's all a long way from settled.

357
00:25:08,132 --> 00:25:11,885
- You mustn't take it personally.
- No, I do take it personally, Mrs Hughes.

358
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:16,931
I can't stand by and watch our family
threatened with a loss of all they hold dear.

359
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:21,686
- They are not our family.
- Well, they're all the family I've got.

360
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:28,526
I beg your pardon.

361
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:38,036
Do you ever wish you'd gone another way?

362
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:47,462
Worked in a shop or a factory?
Had a wife and children?

363
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:49,797
Do you?

364
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:55,136
I don't know. Maybe.

365
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:57,096
Sometimes.

366
00:25:58,015 --> 00:25:59,724
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

367
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:03,311
William's laid tea in the library,
but her ladyship hasn't come down.

368
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:07,190
Oh, she'll be tired.
Take a tray up to her bedroom.

369
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:09,943
- Is Thomas back?
- Not yet, Mr Carson.

370
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:17,033
He asked if he could run down the village,
I didn't see why not.

371
00:26:43,394 --> 00:26:45,103
It's iniquitous.

372
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:49,232
They can't expect you to sit by silent
as your fortune is stolen away.

373
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:50,358
Can't they?

374
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:53,361
His lordship would never let it happen.

375
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:56,114
How's Bates working out?

376
00:26:56,699 --> 00:26:59,200
Well, I don't like to say.

377
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:05,456
Only it seems unkind to criticise a man
for an affliction, my lady.

378
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:09,335
Even if it means he can't do his job.

379
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:18,386
How are you settling in?

380
00:27:19,013 --> 00:27:22,890
Very well, I think.
Unless your lordship feels differently.

381
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:24,559
No complaints?

382
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:27,729
If I had any, I should take them to Mr Carson,
my lord, not you.

383
00:27:27,855 --> 00:27:29,230
(LAUGHS)

384
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:31,316
You're probably right.

385
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:36,237
And the house hasn't worn you out
with the endless stairs and everything?

386
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:40,033
I like the house, my lord.
I like it as a place to work.

387
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:45,079
- What happened?
- Oh, it's only the old wound.

388
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:47,999
After I left the army, I'd a spot of bother

389
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:53,087
and just when I got through that
about a year ago my knee started playing up.

390
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:56,924
A bit ofshrapnel got left in or something
and it moved, but it's fine.

391
00:27:57,051 --> 00:27:58,343
It's not a problem.

392
00:27:58,427 --> 00:28:01,846
And you'd let me know ifyou felt
it was all too much for you?

393
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,057
I would. But it won't be.

394
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:07,393
Thomas.

395
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:11,356
- And where have you been?
- The village.

396
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,735
- To send a telegram, ifyou must know.
- Ooh, pardon me for living.

397
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:24,077
Well, Murray didn't stay long.

398
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:30,875
- Does her ladyship know how they left it?
- No.

399
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:34,462
They talked it all through
on the way back from the church.

400
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,798
If I was still his valet, I'd get it out of him.

401
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:39,967
- Bates won't say a word.
- He will not.

402
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:44,722
I bet you a tenner he's a spy
in the other direction.

403
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:47,767
I wanted thatjob.

404
00:28:48,102 --> 00:28:49,811
We were all right together,
his lordship and me.

405
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:53,940
Then be sure to get your foot in the door
when Bates is gone.

406
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:57,652
You can't get rid of him
just because he talks behind our backs.

407
00:28:57,778 --> 00:29:00,113
There's more than one way to skin a cat.

408
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:05,410
- Perhaps she misunderstood.
- No, it was quite plain.

409
00:29:05,828 --> 00:29:08,413
O'Brien told her
Bates can't do the job properly.

410
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:09,997
Why was he taken on?

411
00:29:10,124 --> 00:29:13,334
Oh, he was Lord Grantham's batman
when he was fighting the Boers.

412
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:15,586
I know that, but even so.

413
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:17,588
- I think it's romantic.
- I don't.

414
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:19,757
How can a valet do his work if he's lame?

415
00:29:19,842 --> 00:29:21,676
He's not very lame.

416
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:24,846
There. Anything else before I go down?

417
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:27,140
No, that's it. Thank you.

418
00:29:35,858 --> 00:29:37,692
Oh, I hate black.

419
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,444
It's not for long.

420
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:42,447
Mama says we can go into
half-mourning next month.

421
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:44,031
And back to colours by September.

422
00:29:44,158 --> 00:29:47,702
- Still seems a lot for a cousin.
- But not a fiance?

423
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:54,375
- He wasn't really a fiance.
- No?

424
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:58,463
I thought that was what you call a man
you're going to marry.

425
00:29:58,547 --> 00:30:01,632
I was only going to marry him
if nothing better turned up.

426
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:04,552
- Mary, what a horrid thing to say.
- Don't worry.

427
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,888
Edith would have taken him, wouldn't you?

428
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:09,557
Yes, I'd have taken him.

429
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:14,729
Lfyou'd given me the chance,
I'd have taken him like a shot.

430
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:18,649
I just think you should know
it's not working, Mr Carson.

431
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:21,152
Do you mean Mr Bates is lazy?

432
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:25,239
Not lazy, exactly. But he just can't carry.

433
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:27,074
He can hardly manage his lordship's cases.

434
00:30:27,201 --> 00:30:29,994
You saw how it was when they went up
to London for the memorial.

435
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:31,579
He can't help with
the guests' luggage neither.

436
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:33,748
And as for waiting at table,
we can forget that.

437
00:30:33,874 --> 00:30:36,834
- And what do you want me to do?
- Well, it's not for me to say.

438
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:40,338
But is it fair on William
to have all the extra work?

439
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:43,758
I don't believe you'd like to think
the house was falling below

440
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,760
the way things ought to be.

441
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:49,055
- I would not.
- That's all I'm saying.

442
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:01,234
I'm going down. Coming?

443
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,736
In a moment. You go.

444
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:15,122
I know you're sad about Patrick.

445
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:17,458
Whatever you say, I know it.

446
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:20,127
You're a darling.

447
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:26,133
But you see, I'm not as sad as I should be.

448
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:28,636
And that's what makes me sad.

449
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:32,139
Thank you.

450
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:35,560
- I'll do that.
- No. No, thank you, my lord.

451
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:37,645
- I can do it.
- I'm sure.

452
00:31:38,981 --> 00:31:41,941
I hope so, my lord. I hope you're sure.

453
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:44,485
Bates, we have to be sensible.

454
00:31:44,987 --> 00:31:47,822
I won't be doing you a favour in the long run
if it's too much for you.

455
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:49,907
No matter what we've been through,
it's got to work.

456
00:31:49,992 --> 00:31:53,327
Ofcourse it has, sir. I mean, my lord.

457
00:31:53,996 --> 00:31:55,621
Do you miss the army, Bates?

458
00:31:55,706 --> 00:31:58,332
I miss a lot ofthings, but you have to
keep moving, don't you?

459
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:00,668
(CHUCKLING) You do, indeed.

460
00:32:02,004 --> 00:32:05,214
I'll show you, my lord, I promise.
I won't let you down.

461
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,967
We've managed so far, haven't we?

462
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:10,678
Yes, we have. Ofcourse we have.

463
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:13,389
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

464
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:17,393
- You look very nice.
- Thank you, darling.

465
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:21,564
- Did Murray make matters clearer?
- Yes, I'm afraid he did.

466
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:35,786
By the way, O'Brien says Bates is
causing a lot of awkwardness downstairs.

467
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:37,872
You may have to do something about it.

468
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:40,374
She's always making trouble.

469
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,836
Is that fair when she hasn't mentioned it
before now?

470
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:46,172
I don't know why you listen to her.

471
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:51,510
It is quite eccentric, even for you,
to have a crippled valet.

472
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:54,680
Please, don't use that word.

473
00:32:55,057 --> 00:32:57,975
Did he tell you he couldn't walk
when he made his application?

474
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,268
Don't exaggerate.

475
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:02,021
Doesn't it strike you as dishonest
not to mention it?

476
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:04,607
- I knew he'd been wounded.
- You never said.

477
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:07,401
You know I don't care to talk about all that.

478
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:11,572
Ofcourse I understand what it must be like
to have fought alongside someone in a war.

479
00:33:11,782 --> 00:33:14,492
- Oh, you understand that, do you?
- Certainly I do.

480
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:17,244
You must form the most tremendous bonds.

481
00:33:17,371 --> 00:33:19,789
- Even with a servant.
- Really?

482
00:33:20,082 --> 00:33:21,916
Even with a servant?

483
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:25,211
Oh, Robert, don't catch me out.

484
00:33:26,213 --> 00:33:29,256
I'm simply saying I fully see
why you want to help him.

485
00:33:29,383 --> 00:33:30,383
But?

486
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:34,303
But is this the right way,
to employ him for ajob he can't do?

487
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:36,847
Is it any wonder ifthe others' noses
are put out?

488
00:33:36,932 --> 00:33:38,599
I just want to give him a chance.

489
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:48,109
Mama, I'm sorry,
no one told me you were here.

490
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:50,653
Oh, dear, such a glare.

491
00:33:51,822 --> 00:33:56,200
- I feel as if I were on stage at the Gaiety.
- ROBERT: We're used to it.

492
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:59,704
I do wish you'd let me install it
in the Dower House. It's very convenient.

493
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:02,540
The man who manages the generator
could look after yours as well.

494
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:07,086
No. I couldn't have electricity in the house.
I wouldn't sleep a wink.

495
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:08,963
All those vapours seeping about.

496
00:34:09,089 --> 00:34:10,756
Even Cora won't have it in the bedroom.

497
00:34:10,841 --> 00:34:14,051
She did wonder about the kitchens,
but I couldn't see the point.

498
00:34:14,136 --> 00:34:18,305
Well, before anyone joins us,
I'm glad ofthis chance for a little talk.

499
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:25,813
- I gather Murray was here today?
- News travels fast. Yes.

500
00:34:25,939 --> 00:34:29,942
I saw him and he's not optimistic
that there's anything we can do.

501
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:34,280
- Well, I refuse to believe it.
- Be that as it may, it's a fact.

502
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:38,826
- But to lose Cora's fortune to...
- (ROBERT SIGHS)

503
00:34:38,952 --> 00:34:41,245
Really, Mama, you know as well as I do

504
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:44,415
that Cora's fortune
is not Cora's fortune any more.

505
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:47,126
Thanks to Papa, it is now part ofthe estate.

506
00:34:47,294 --> 00:34:51,839
And the estate is entailed to my heir,
that is it. That is all of it.

507
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:57,011
- Robert, dear, I don't mean to sound harsh...
- You may not mean to, but I bet you will.

508
00:34:57,137 --> 00:35:01,891
Twenty-four years ago you married Cora,
against my wishes, for her money.

509
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:07,688
Give it away now, what was the point
ofyour peculiar marriage in the first place?

510
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:11,817
If I were to tell you she'd made me
very happy, would that stretch belief?

511
00:35:11,902 --> 00:35:14,320
It's not why you chose her,

512
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:18,741
above all those other girls
who could've filled my shoes so easily.

513
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:23,704
Lfyou must know, when I think of my motives
for pursuing Cora, I'm ashamed.

514
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:26,874
There's no need to remind me ofthem.

515
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:30,002
Don't you care about Downton?

516
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:33,714
What do you think?

517
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:37,051
I've given my life to Downton.

518
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:40,513
I was born here and I hope to die here.

519
00:35:41,223 --> 00:35:44,517
I claim no career beyond the nurture
ofthis house and the estate.

520
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:47,186
It is my third parent and my fourth child.

521
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:50,564
Do I care about it? Yes, I do care!

522
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:55,027
I hope I don't hear sounds of a disagreement.

523
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:58,489
(CHUCKLING) Oh, is that what they call
discussion in New York?

524
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:02,076
Well, I'm glad you're fighting.
I'm glad somebody's putting up a fight.

525
00:36:02,244 --> 00:36:04,411
You're not really fighting Granny,
are you, Papa?

526
00:36:04,538 --> 00:36:08,916
Your grandmother merely wishes
to do the right thing. And so do I.

Oh, you sound like a penny dreadful.

539
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:30,020
I expect you saw worse things
in South Africa. Eh, Mr Bates?

540
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:33,065
Not worse, but pretty bad.

541
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:34,525
Did you enjoy the war?

542
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:38,153
I don't think anyone enjoys war,
but there are some good memories, too.

543
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,655
I'm sure there are.

544
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:42,616
Mr Bates, would you hand me that tray?

- I'll do it.
- Sorry.

The lordship's taken his port to the library.

we'll eat in 15 minutes.

(CARSON SIGHING)

552
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:21,155
Well, I keep forgetting. Does this go
next door or back to the kitchen?

553
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:24,742
Those go back, but the dessert service and
all the glasses stay in the upstairs pantry.

554
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:26,535
Put it on here.

555
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:31,874
What is it?

556
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,169
Her ladyship's told him
she thinks Mr Bates ought to go.

557
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:39,423
She said to me, "Ifonly his lordship
had been content with Thomas."

558
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,258
Did she really?

559
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:44,845
- What are you doing up here?
- It's a free country.

560
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:52,853
Well, I'm going for my dinner.
You two can stay here plotting.

561
00:38:04,908 --> 00:38:09,870
So, the young Duke of Crowborough
is asking himselfto stay.

562
00:38:09,955 --> 00:38:11,705
And we know why.

563
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:15,250
You hope you know why.
That is not at all the same.

564
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:19,880
You realise the Duke thinks Mary's prospects
have altered.

565
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:24,385
- I suppose so.
- There's no "suppose" about it.

566
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:28,639
Ofcourse, this is exactly the sort
ofopportunity that will come to Mary

567

ifwe can only get things settled
in her favour.

- Is Robert coming round?
- Not yet.

569
00:38:36,106 --> 00:38:41,068
To him, the risk is we succeed in saving
my money but not the estate.

570
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:46,490
He feels he'd be betraying his duty
if Downton were lost because of him.

- Well, I'm going to write to Murray.
- He won't say anything different.

00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:55,124
Well, we have to start somewhere.
Our duty is to Mary.

(SIGHING) Well, give him a date
for when Mary's out of mourning.

Oh, do stop admiring yourself.
He's not marrying you for your looks.

That's if he wants to marry you at all.

Very well. You should go out to greet them.

- And me, Mr Carson?
- No, Daisy, not you.

585
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:49,178
Can you manage, Mr Bates?
Or would you rather wait here?

586
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:50,387
I want to go, Mr Carson.

587
00:39:50,472 --> 00:39:52,806
Well, there's no obligation
for the whole staffto be present.

588
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:54,349
- I'd like to be there.
- Hmm.

589
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:57,644
Well, it's certainly a great day for Downton

590
00:39:57,729 --> 00:40:00,397
to welcome a duke under our roof.

591

Remember to help me with the luggage.
Don't go running off.

592
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,277
I'll give you a hand.

593
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:09,198
Oh, I couldn't ask that, Mr Bates,
not in your condition.

594
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:14,328
How long do we have to put up with this,
Mr Carson, just so I know?

595
00:40:45,527 --> 00:40:47,444
Welcome to Downton.

596
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:49,446
Lady Grantham, this is so kind ofyou.

597
00:40:49,531 --> 00:40:53,200
Not at all, Duke.
I'm delighted you could spare the time.

598
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:56,120
- You know my daughter Mary, ofcourse.
- Ofcourse, Lady Mary.

599
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:58,914
And Edith, but I don't believe
you've met my youngest, Sybil.

600

- How do you do?

Come on in, you must be worn out.

602
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:08,215
Oh, Lady Grantham,
I've a confession to make,

603
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,967
which I hope won't cause too much bother.

604

My man has taken ill just as I was leaving,
so I...

605
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:15,347
Oh, well, that won't be a problem,
will it, Carson?

606
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:18,475
Certainly not.
I shall look after His Grace myself.

607
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:22,729
Oh, no, I wouldn't dream of being
such a nuisance. Surely a footman...

00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,526
Didn't you serve me when I dined
with Lady Grantham in London?

610
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:30,320
- I did, Your Grace.
- Ah, there we are.

- Thomas.

He didn't spoil anything. He fell over.

The plain fact is Mr Bates,
through no fault of his own,

684
00:46:57,273 --> 00:47:00,734
is not able to fulfil the extra duties
expected of him.

685
00:47:01,736 --> 00:47:07,532
He can't lift. He can't serve a table.
He's dropping things all over the place.

00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:11,745
On a night like tonight
he should act as a third footman.

I don't know what happened.

The thing is, Bates,
I said I'd give you a trial and I have.

If it were only up to me...

709
00:48:58,477 --> 00:49:01,563
It's this question of a valet's extra duties.

710
00:49:01,981 --> 00:49:03,898
You mean waiting a table
when there's a large party?

00:49:03,983 --> 00:49:06,651
That and carrying things and...

712
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:15,410
You do see that Carson can't be expected
to compromise the efficiency of his staff.

713
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:17,954
I do, my lord, ofcourse I do.

714
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:20,624
Might I make a suggestion?

715
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:24,169
That when an extra footman is required,
the cost could come out of my wages.

716
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:26,796
Absolutely not.
I couldn't possibly allow that.

717
00:49:26,881 --> 00:49:30,925
Because I am very eager to stay, my lord.
Very eager, indeed.

718
00:49:33,012 --> 00:49:36,598
I know you are.
And I was eager that this should work.

719
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:44,272
You see, it is unlikely that I should find
another position.

720
00:49:44,565 --> 00:49:47,233
But surely in a smaller house,
where less is expected ofyou.

721
00:49:47,443 --> 00:49:48,902
It's not likely.

722
00:49:50,279 --> 00:49:52,113
I mean to help until you find something.

723
00:49:52,198 --> 00:49:57,035
I couldn't take your money, my lord.
I can take wages for ajob done. That's all.

724
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:06,961
Very good, my lord. I'll go at once.

725
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:10,090
There's no need to rush out into the night.
Take the London train tomorrow.

It leaves at 9:00.

727
00:50:11,884 --> 00:50:15,178
You'll have a month's wages, too.
That I insist on.

728
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:26,022
It's a bloody business, Bates,
but I can't see any way around it.

729
00:50:26,232 --> 00:50:28,566
I quite understand, my lord.

730
00:50:37,243 --> 00:50:40,870
I'm afraid we're rather
a female party tonight, Duke.

But you know what it's like trying to balance
numbers in the country.

No, I'm terribly flattered
to be dining en famille.

What were you and Mary doing
in the attics this afternoon?

735

I expect Mary was just showing the Duke
the house. Weren't you?

736
00:51:05,563 --> 00:51:08,857
- Are you a student of architecture?
- Mmm, absolutely.

737

Then I do hope you'll come
and inspect my little cottage.

00:51:27,293 --> 00:51:31,463
Looking around?
What is there to look at but servants' rooms?

745

- Will you hold your tongue!

749
00:51:53,986 --> 00:51:56,029
How long do you think they'll be?
I'm starving.

750
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:58,698
- Have you settled the ladies?
- Yes, Mr Carson.

751
00:51:58,783 --> 00:52:01,326
Then it won't be long once they go through.

752
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:03,578
DAISY: You think he'll speak out?

753
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:06,456
Do you think we'll have a duchess
to wait on? Imagine that.

754
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,666
You won't be waiting on her,
whatever happens.

755
00:52:08,751 --> 00:52:12,212
There is no reason why the eldest daughter
and heiress ofthe Earl of Grantham

756
00:52:12,296 --> 00:52:15,215
should not wear a duchess's coronet
with honour.

757
00:52:15,299 --> 00:52:18,593
Heiress, Mr Carson? Has it been decided?

758
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:22,055
It will be, ifthere's any justice in the world.

759
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:24,557
Well, we'll know soon enough.

760
00:52:25,601 --> 00:52:26,726
What are you doing, Anna?

761
00:52:26,811 --> 00:52:32,106
I thought I'd take something up to Mr Bates,
him not being well enough to come down.

762
00:52:32,483 --> 00:52:36,528
- You don't mind, do you, Mrs Hughes?
- I don't mind. Not this once.

763
00:52:36,612 --> 00:52:39,280
No, take him whatever he might need.

764
00:52:40,241 --> 00:52:43,910
Mr Bates is leaving
without a stain on his character.

765
00:52:44,328 --> 00:52:47,455
I hope you all observe that
in the manner ofyour parting.

766
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:50,333
Well, I don't see why he has to go.
I don't mind doing a bit ofextra work...

767
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:52,252
It's not up to you.

768
00:52:52,962 --> 00:52:55,171
I'll take care of his lordship.
Shall I, Mr Carson?

769
00:52:55,256 --> 00:52:57,674
Not while you're looking after the Duke,
you won't.

770
00:52:57,758 --> 00:53:00,885
(CHUCKLES) I'll see to his lordship myself.

771
00:53:02,805 --> 00:53:04,514
(SOFT SOBBING)

772
00:53:15,985 --> 00:53:17,402
(SIGHING)

773
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:22,323
(SOBBING CONTINUES)

774
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:35,044
Mr Bates? Are you there?

775
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:39,048
(SIGHING)

776
00:53:51,979 --> 00:53:55,231
I brought something up,
in case you were hungry.

777
00:53:57,276 --> 00:53:59,152
That's very kind.

778
00:54:10,748 --> 00:54:14,208
- I'm ever so sorry you're going.
- I'll be all right.

779
00:54:16,754 --> 00:54:18,546
Ofcourse you will.

780
00:54:19,131 --> 00:54:22,050
There's always a place for a man like you.

781
00:54:22,134 --> 00:54:25,345
Oh, yes. Something will turn up.

782
00:54:29,183 --> 00:54:31,559
Tell us when you're fixed.

783
00:54:32,019 --> 00:54:34,729
Just... drop us a line.

784
00:54:36,357 --> 00:54:38,149
Else I'll worry.

785
00:54:38,984 --> 00:54:42,028
Well, we can't have that.

786
00:54:58,379 --> 00:55:00,129
(ANNA SNIFFLING)

787
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:04,133
We must go and let the servants get in here.

788
00:55:04,218 --> 00:55:06,344
I should be grateful
ifwe could stay just a minute more.

789
00:55:06,512 --> 00:55:09,263
I have... I have something to ask you.

790
00:55:15,896 --> 00:55:18,815
I was terribly sorry
to hear about your cousins.

791
00:55:18,899 --> 00:55:20,316
You said.

792
00:55:21,068 --> 00:55:22,110
Did you know them?

793
00:55:22,194 --> 00:55:26,114
Not well. I used to see Patrick Crawley
at the odd thing.

794
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:31,202
I imagine it will mean
some adjustments for you all.

795
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:38,209
To lose two heirs in one night, it's terrible.

796
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:41,212
- Indeed, it was terrible.
- Awful.

797
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:48,803
But then again, it's an ill wind.

798
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:54,308
At least Lady Mary's prospects
must have rather improved.

799
00:55:55,561 --> 00:55:57,020
Have they?

800
00:55:59,023 --> 00:56:00,606
Haven't they?

801
00:56:01,233 --> 00:56:03,359
(INHALES DEEPLY) I will not be coy

802
00:56:03,444 --> 00:56:06,029
and pretend I do not understand
your meaning,

803
00:56:06,113 --> 00:56:10,366
though you seem very informed
on this family's private affairs.

804
00:56:11,118 --> 00:56:15,371
But you ought perhaps to know
that I do not intend to fight the entail.

805
00:56:15,456 --> 00:56:17,415
Not any part of it.

806
00:56:18,959 --> 00:56:20,918
You can't be serious.

807
00:56:22,129 --> 00:56:24,672
It pains me to say it, but I am.

808
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:32,013
You'll give up your entire estate?

809
00:56:32,264 --> 00:56:36,059
Your wife's money into the bargain,
to a perfect stranger?

810
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:38,061
You won't even put up a fight?

811
00:56:38,145 --> 00:56:41,606
I hope he proves to be perfect,
but I rather doubt it.

812
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:42,940
Ha.

813
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:45,735
Very odd thing to joke about.

814
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:48,362
No odder than this conversation.

815
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:52,200
So, there you have it.

816
00:56:53,202 --> 00:56:56,496
But Mary will still have her settlement,
which you won't find ungenerous.

817
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:57,955
(COUGHS)

818
00:56:58,207 --> 00:57:01,626
- (CLEARING THROAT) I'm sorry?
- I only meant that

819
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:06,172
her portion, when she marries,
will be more than respectable.

820
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:09,509
- You'll be pleased, I promise you.
- Oh, heavens.

821
00:57:09,593 --> 00:57:12,261
- I hope I haven't given the wrong impression.
- You know very well...

822
00:57:12,346 --> 00:57:15,598
- My dear Lord Grantham...
- Don't "My dear Lord Grantham" me!

823
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:18,935
You knew what you were doing
when you came here.

824
00:57:19,186 --> 00:57:21,562
You encouraged Mary, all of us,
into thinking...

825
00:57:21,647 --> 00:57:25,900
Forgive me, but I came
to express my sympathies and my friendship.

826
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:27,401
Nothing more.

827
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:33,991
Lady Mary is a charming person.
Whoever marries her will be a lucky man.

828
00:57:35,077 --> 00:57:37,453
It will not, however, be me.

829
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:41,833
I see, and what was it you asked me
to stay behind to hear?

830
00:57:45,921 --> 00:57:47,547
I... I forget.

831
00:58:02,146 --> 00:58:05,356
Well, aren't you coming
into the drawing room?

832
00:58:05,691 --> 00:58:10,194
I'm... I'm tired. I think I'll just slip away.
Please make my excuses.

833
00:58:10,779 --> 00:58:13,948
I'm afraid I've worn you out.
Tomorrow we can just...

834
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:17,243
I'm leaving in the morning. Good night.

835
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:22,582
Oh, you might tell that footman...

836
00:58:22,833 --> 00:58:26,335
- Thomas.
- Thomas. You might tell him I've gone up.

837
00:58:44,313 --> 00:58:46,314
So he slipped the hook?

838
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:51,402
At least I'm not fishing with no bait.

839
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:02,496
I don't believe that.

840
00:59:03,207 --> 00:59:07,168
Well, believe what you like.
He won't break the entail.

841
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:11,380
The unknown cousin gets everything

842
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:15,092
(SIGHING) and Mary's inheritance
will be the same as it always was.

843
00:59:15,177 --> 00:59:17,136
Oh, how was I to know?
When the lawyer turned up, I thought...

844
00:59:17,221 --> 00:59:20,473
You weren't to and you did the right thing
to telegraph me.

845
00:59:20,599 --> 00:59:23,768
- It's just not going to come off.
- So what now?

846
00:59:25,854 --> 00:59:28,814
(LAUGHS) Well, you know how I'm fixed.

847
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:34,695
I have to have an heiress,
if it means going to New York to find one.

848
00:59:37,074 --> 00:59:38,699
What about me?

849
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:44,705
You... You will wish me well.

850
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:48,167
You said you'd find me ajob
if I wanted to leave.

851
00:59:48,252 --> 00:59:49,710
And do you?

852
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:53,005
I want to be a valet.
I'm sick of being a footman.

853
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:55,716
Yeah, Thomas, I don't need a valet.

854
00:59:57,844 --> 00:59:59,971
I thought you were
getting rid ofthe new one here.

855
01:00:00,055 --> 01:00:04,600
And I've done it, but I'm not sure
Carson's going to let me take over.

856
01:00:08,105 --> 01:00:10,273
And I want to be with you.

857
01:00:10,816 --> 01:00:11,983
Mmm.

858
01:00:24,121 --> 01:00:26,998
I just can't see it working, can you?

859
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:32,086
(LAUGHING) We don't seem to have the basis
of a servant-master relationship, do we?

860
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:35,673
- You came here to be with me.
- Among other reasons.

861
01:00:39,136 --> 01:00:42,305
And one swallow doesn't make a summer.

862
01:00:58,363 --> 01:01:01,240
- Aren't you forgetting something?
- What?

863
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:05,411
(LAUGHS) Are you threatening me?

864
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:11,167
Because of a youthful dalliance?

865
01:01:11,251 --> 01:01:13,252
A few weeks of madness
in a London season?

866
01:01:13,337 --> 01:01:15,171
You wouldn't hold that against me, surely?

867
01:01:15,255 --> 01:01:17,214
I would if I have to.

868
01:01:22,387 --> 01:01:26,098
And who'd believe a greedy footman
over the words of a duke?

869
01:01:26,183 --> 01:01:29,560
Lfyou're not careful,
you'll end up behind bars.

870
01:01:30,062 --> 01:01:31,812
I've got proof.

871
01:01:33,273 --> 01:01:34,732
Mmm-hmm.

872
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:37,818
You mean these?

873
01:01:43,909 --> 01:01:45,659
(BOTH GRUNTING)

874
01:01:51,917 --> 01:01:53,584
(THOMAS PANTING)

875
01:01:54,252 --> 01:01:57,922
You know, my mother's always telling me
never put anything in writing.

876
01:01:58,006 --> 01:02:00,925
And now, thanks to you, I never will again.

877
01:02:01,009 --> 01:02:02,468
How did you get them?

878
01:02:03,095 --> 01:02:06,263
- You bastard.
- Don't be a bad loser, Thomas.

879
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:07,932
Go to bed.

880
01:02:09,309 --> 01:02:11,352
Unless you want to stay.

881
01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:42,007
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

882
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:46,595
I think I'll turn in.

883
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:49,056
- No big announcement, then?
- No.

884
01:02:49,141 --> 01:02:52,268
Nor likely to be. He's offon the 9:00 train.

885
01:02:52,352 --> 01:02:53,811
He never is!

886
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:56,689
And when we've had a turkey killed
for tomorrow's dinner!

887
01:02:56,773 --> 01:03:00,025
- I wonder what she did wrong.
- She did nothing wrong.

888
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:02,987
Not from the way his lordship was talking.

889
01:03:03,155 --> 01:03:06,240
So His Grace turned out to be graceless.

890
01:03:08,326 --> 01:03:10,411
Good night, Mrs Hughes.

891
01:03:10,495 --> 01:03:12,455
Good night, Mr Carson.

892
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:19,462
Lfyou knew that was your decision,
why put Mary through it?

893
01:03:19,546 --> 01:03:23,549
But I didn't know it was my decision,
my final decision, until tonight.

894
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:28,012
But I find I cannot ruin the estate
or hollow out the title for the sake of Mary,

895
01:03:28,096 --> 01:03:30,639
even with a better man than that.

896
01:03:30,724 --> 01:03:33,225
I try to understand. I just can't.

897
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:36,353
Well, why should you?
Downton is in my blood and in my bones.

898
01:03:36,438 --> 01:03:38,063
It's not in yours.

899
01:03:38,148 --> 01:03:40,191
And I can no more be the cause
of its destruction

900
01:03:40,275 --> 01:03:42,359
than I could betray my country.

901
01:03:42,444 --> 01:03:45,279
Besides, how was I to know
he wouldn't take her without the money?

902
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:47,698
Don't pretend to be a child
because it suits you.

903
01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:50,701
(SIGHING) Do you think she would've
been happy with a fortune hunter?

904
01:03:50,785 --> 01:03:52,578
She might've been.

905
01:03:52,996 --> 01:03:54,205
I was.

906
01:03:57,417 --> 01:04:01,378
Have you been happy?
Really, have I made you happy?

907
01:04:02,255 --> 01:04:03,839
Yes.

908
01:04:07,552 --> 01:04:10,930
That is, since you fell in love with me,
which, if I remember correctly,

909
01:04:11,014 --> 01:04:13,516
was about a year after we were married.

910
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:16,519
Not a year. Not as long as that.

911
01:04:17,062 --> 01:04:20,523
- But it wouldn't have happened for Mary.
- Why not?

912
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:25,110
Because I am so much nicer
than the Duke of Crowborough.

913
01:04:25,737 --> 01:04:27,029
I'll be the judge ofthat.

914
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:28,906
(ROBERT CHUCKLES)

915
01:04:30,992 --> 01:04:34,036
Just don't think
I'm going to let it rest, Robert.

916
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,664
I haven't given up by any means.

917
01:04:38,458 --> 01:04:43,003
- I must do what my conscience tells me.
- And so must I.

918
01:04:44,756 --> 01:04:48,133
And I don't want you to think I'll let it rest.

919
01:04:48,927 --> 01:04:50,636
(ROBERT CHUCKLES)

920
01:05:00,647 --> 01:05:05,234
My lord, would it be acceptable
for Bates to ride in front with Taylor?

921
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:07,528
Otherwise, it means getting the other car out.

922
01:05:07,612 --> 01:05:10,030
He and His Grace are catching the same train.

923
01:05:10,115 --> 01:05:11,949
Perfectly acceptable.

924
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:15,411
And if His Grace doesn't like it,
he can lump it.

925
01:05:28,967 --> 01:05:31,176
You've been so kind, Lady Grantham.
Thank you.

926
01:05:31,261 --> 01:05:32,928
Goodbye, Duke.

927
01:05:33,263 --> 01:05:35,723
You'll make my farewells
to your delightful daughters?

928
01:05:35,807 --> 01:05:38,142
They'd have been down
ifthey'd known you were leaving so soon.

929
01:05:38,226 --> 01:05:41,520
Alas, something's come up
which has taken me quite by surprise.

930
01:05:41,605 --> 01:05:43,063
Obviously.

931
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:46,317
Well, Grantham, this has been
a highly enjoyable interlude.

932
01:05:46,401 --> 01:05:48,736
Has it?
And I feared it had proved a disappointment.

933
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:50,029
Not at all, not at all.

934
01:05:50,113 --> 01:05:52,573
A short stay in your lovely house
has driven away my cares.

935
01:05:52,657 --> 01:05:56,619
We ought to go, my lord,
if His Grace is to catch the train.

936
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:01,540
Goodbye, Bates, and good luck.

937
01:06:03,168 --> 01:06:05,294
Good luck to you, my lord.

938
01:06:23,855 --> 01:06:25,189
Wait!

939
01:06:28,151 --> 01:06:31,403
- Get out, Bates.
- DUKE: I really mustn't be late.

940
01:06:33,406 --> 01:06:36,700
Get back inside
and we'll say no more about it.

941
01:06:51,758 --> 01:06:53,926
It wasn't right, Carson.

942
01:06:54,594 --> 01:06:57,096
I just didn't think it was right.

943
01:07:14,531 --> 01:07:17,282
- First post, ma'am.
- Thank you, Ellen.

944
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:23,789
- One for you.
- Hmm. Thank you, Mother.

945
01:07:34,217 --> 01:07:38,721
- Oh, it's from Lord Grantham.
- Really? What on earth does he want?

946
01:07:41,558 --> 01:07:43,892
He wants to change our lives.
